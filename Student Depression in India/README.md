## Key Insights

### Gender Distribution and Depression
- The dataset contains **25% more males than females**.
- The analysis also revealed the number of depressed students for each gender, providing insights into gender disparities in mental health challenges.

### Age and Depression
- Students aged **20, 24, 28, 18, and 21** are the most affected by depression.
- These ages, often at the start of academic or professional careers, indicate vulnerability to depression due to academic pressures and career-related stress.

### Impact of Sleep Duration
- Sleep patterns play a significant role in student mental health:
  - **5 hours of sleep**: Students are most likely to report depression.
  - **8 hours of sleep**: Students are least likely to report depression, with nearly **2,300 fewer depressed individuals** compared to the 5-hour group.

### Suicidal Thoughts by Age
- Data highlights:
  - **Age 20** has the highest suicidal thoughts among all age groups, followed by **19** and **18**.
  - The top 3 age groups with the highest ratios of suicidal thoughts are **18, 19, and 20**. For instance, **18-year-olds** have a suicidal thoughts ratio of **2.38**, indicating more "Yes" than "No" responses.

### Degrees and Suicidal Thoughts
- **Class 12** students have the highest ratio of suicidal thoughts at **2.23**.
- **PhD students** are among the top 10 degrees with the least ratio of suicidal thoughts, suggesting advanced education may reduce stress-related mental health challenges.

### Family History of Mental Illness
- Students with a family history of mental illness are more likely to report depression compared to those without. While the difference is not drastic, it is significant enough to confirm a correlation.
